# huntable
Comparator function for tables with dynamic values

## Installation

1. Install via [LuaRocks](http://luarocks.org):

   `$ luarocks install huntable`

2. [Download](https://github.com/olueiro/huntable/archive/master.zip) and extract inside your project

   `local huntable = require("huntable")`

## Usage

`huntable(source[, condition1[, condition2[, ...]]])`
* `source` Table to lookup;
   - if `source` is nil, function returns false;
* `condition1` ... `conditionN` Table with conditions to check;

## Sample

```lua
-- Consider this table as 'source'
local source = {
  level1_A = {
    level2_A = 1,
    level2_B = "sample",
    level2_B = "1.0",
  },
  level1_B = "sample_B",
  level1_C = {
    level2_A = "sample_C"
    level2_B = {
      level3_A = 10,
      level3_B = nil
    }
  }
}

huntable(source) -- returns true, 'source' is valid
huntable(source, {"level1_A"}) -- returns true, a key named 'level1_A' exists in source
huntable(source, {"level2_A"}) -- returns true, a key named 'level2_A' exists in source
huntable(source, {"level1_Z"}) -- returns false, a key named 'level1_Z' not exists in source
huntable(source, {"level2_A", "level1_B"}) -- returns true, a key named 'level2_A' exists in source AND a key named 'level1_B' exists in source
huntable(source, {level2_A = 1}) -- returns true, a key named 'level2_A' exists in source AND value is integer 1
huntable(source, {level2_A = "sample_C"}) -- returns true, a key named 'level2_A' exists in source AND value is string "sample_C"
huntable(source, {level1_B = "sample_B"}) -- returns true, a key named 'level1_B' exists in source AND value is string "sample_B"
huntable(source, {level2_A = 2}) -- returns false, a key named 'level2_A' exists in source AND value is not integer 2
huntable(source, {level2_A = "sample_Z"}) -- returns false, a key named 'level2_A' exists in source AND value is string "sample_Z"
huntable(source, {level2_A = ">0"}) -- returns true, a key named 'level2_A' exists in source AND value is greater then 0
huntable(source, {level2_B = ">0"}) -- returns true, a key named 'level2_B' exists in source AND value is greater then 0 (1.0)
huntable(source, {level2_A = ">=0"}) -- returns true, a key named 'level2_A' exists in source AND value is greater or equal then 0
huntable(source, {level2_A = "~0"}) -- returns true, a key named 'level2_A' exists in source AND value is non equal to 0
huntable(source, {level2_A = "=0"}) -- returns false, a key named 'level2_A' exists in source AND value is equal to 0
huntable(source, {level2_A = "=0"}) -- returns false, a key named 'level2_A' exists in source AND value is equal to 0
huntable(source, {level1_B = "!Sample_C"}) -- returns true, a key named 'level1_B' exists in source AND value is equal to string "sample_C" (case insensitive comparison)
huntable(source, {level1_B = "~sample_C"}) -- returns false, a key named 'level1_B' exists in source AND value is equal to string "sample_C", cause requires a different value
huntable(source, {level1_B = "~"}) -- returns true, a key named 'level1_B' exists in source AND value is not equal to string ""
huntable(source, {level1_B = "?C"}) -- returns true, a key named 'level1_B' exists in source AND value contains "C" (pattern comparison)
huntable(source, {level1_B = "?^C"}) -- returns false, a key named 'level1_B' exists in source AND value not starts with "C" (pattern comparison)
huntable(source, {level1_B = "?C$"}) -- returns true, a key named 'level1_B' exists in source AND value ends with "C" (pattern comparison)
huntable(source, {level1_B = "=sample_C"}) -- returns true, a key named 'level1_B' exists in source AND value is equal to "sample_C"
huntable(source, {level2_A = {9, 8 , 7, 1}}) -- returns true, a key named 'level2_A' exists in source AND value exists in list (1)
huntable(source, {level2_A = {9, 8 , 7, 6}}) -- returns false, a key named 'level2_A' exists in source AND value not exists in list (1)
huntable(source, {level2_A = 1, level1_B = "sample_B"}) -- returns true, a key named 'level2_A' exists in source AND value is integer 1; a key named 'level1_B' exists in source AND value is string "sample_B"
huntable(source, {level2_A = function(key, value, source) return true end}) -- returns true, a key named 'level2_A' exists in source AND value returns true on function
huntable(source, {level2_A = function(key, value, source) if value == "sample_C" then return true end end}) -- returns true, a key named 'level2_A' exists in source AND value returns true on function, cause exists a key 'level2_A' with value equals to "sample_C"
huntable(source, {{level1_B = "sample_B"}}) -- returns true, a key named 'level1_B' exists in source on root (structured mode - all levels are preserved)
huntable(source, {{level1_A = {}}}) -- returns true, a key named 'level1_A' exists in source  on root (structured mode - all levels are preserved) ANd is a table
huntable(source, {{level1_A = {level2_Z = 1}}}) -- returns false, a key named 'level1_A' exists in source on root (structured mode - all levels are preserved) AND is a table ANd not contains a key named 'level2_Z'
huntable(source, {"level2_A"}, {"level1_B"}) -- returns true, a key named 'level2_A' exists in source; a key named 'level1_B' exists in source
